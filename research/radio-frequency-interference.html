                <h3>RFI Flagging in the UV-Domain</h3>
                <h4>National Radio Astronomy Observatory (Summer 2024)</h4>
                <p>
                    Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) is a significant issue in the field of radio astronomy. At lower radio frequencies,
                    below 1 GHz, the RFI environment is especially active and tends to contaminate observations significantly,
                    resulting in poor image quality. There are several different algorithms and techniques used to flag RFI in the
                    pre-correlation, post-correlation, and post-processing stages, both in the hardware and software realm; each one of 
                    these tools has their own benefits and drawbacks. Most post-processing algorithms operate on the time-frequency plane.
                </p>
                <p>
                    GRIDflag is a UV plane based algorithm designed to flag and remove intermittent RFI from interferometer observations.
                    In aperture synthesis, the irregularly sampled visibilities in UV space are convolved with a gridding function to
                    interpolate their values onto an evenly spaced UV grid. By taking advantage of the redundancy of visibilities inside
                    each UV cell during this gridding process, we identify RFI-corrupted data by comparing these visibilities
                    to some statistical threshold.
                </p>
                <p>
                    GRIDflag shows potential to work effectively in Epoch of Reionization observations, where faint RFI is abundant.
