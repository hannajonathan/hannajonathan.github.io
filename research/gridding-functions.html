                <h3>Anti-Aliasing Gridding Functions</h3>
                <h4>National Radio Astronomy Observatory (Summer 2025)</h4>
                <p>
                    In aperture synthesis, visibilities, representing the Fourier component of the sky brightness distribution, are measured 
                    and accumulated to form a UV plane. To obtain the sky brightness, a fast Fourier transform (FFT) is performed on the 
                    visibilities. The FFT algorithm expects a uniformly sampled input. To satisfy this requirement, the visibility data 
                    must be interpolated onto an evenly spaced grid using a gridding algorithm. The most commonly used gridding algorithm is
                    convolutional resampling, in which each visibility is convolved with a "gridding convolution function" (GCF).

                    This summer, I worked on utilizing five alternative GCFs that showed potential for stronger anti-aliasing 
                    properties compared to the zeroth order prolate spheroidal GCF used in the Common Astronomy Software 
                    Applications: The Blackman-Nuttall, Blackman-Harris, Flat Top, Dolph-Chebyshev, and Kaiser-Bessel apodization
                    functions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Preliminary results showed that all of these GCF candidates except for Flat Top demonstrated a significant improvement in
                    alias suppression, with an additional benefit of reducing point spread function noise as well. The GCFs all had an 
                    increased support size, however. More analysis is currently being done on how significantly this affects the 
                    computational cost.
