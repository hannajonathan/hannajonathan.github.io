                <h3>Anti-Aliasing Gridding Functions</h3>
                <h4>National Radio Astronomy Observatory (Summer 2025)</h4>
                <p>
                    In aperture synthesis, visibilities, representing the Fourier component of the sky brightness distribution, are measured 
                    and accumulated to form a UV plane. To obtain the sky brightness, a fast Fourier transform (FFT) is performed on the 
                    visibilities. The FFT algorithm expects a uniformly sampled input. To satisfy this requirement, the visibility data 
                    must be interpolated onto an evenly spaced grid using a gridding algorithm. The most commonly used gridding algorithm is
                    convolutional resampling, in which each visibility is convolved with a "gridding convolution function" (GCF).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This summer, I worked on utilizing five alternative GCFs that showed potential for stronger anti-aliasing 
                    properties compared to the zeroth order prolate spheroidal GCF used in the Common Astronomy Software 
                    Applications: The Blackman-Nuttall, Blackman-Harris, Flat Top, Dolph-Chebyshev, and Kaiser-Bessel apodization
                    functions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Preliminary results showed that all of these GCF candidates except for Flat Top demonstrated a significant improvement in
                    alias suppression, with an additional benefit of reducing point spread function noise as well. The GCFs all had an 
                    increased support size, however. More analysis is currently being done on how significantly this increases the 
                    computational cost.

                <h3>RFI Flagging in the UV-Domain</h3>
                <h4>National Radio Astronomy Observatory (Summer 2024)</h4>
                <p>
                    Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) is a significant issue in the field of radio astronomy. At lower radio frequencies,
                    below 1 GHz, the RFI environment is especially active and tends to contaminate observations significantly,
                    resulting in poor image quality. There are several different algorithms and techniques used to flag RFI in the
                    pre-correlation, post-correlation, and post-processing stages, both in the hardware and software realm; each one of 
                    these tools has their own benefits and drawbacks. Most post-processing algorithms operate on the time-frequency plane.
                </p>
                <p>
                    GRIDflag is a UV plane based algorithm designed to flag and remove intermittent RFI from interferometer observations.
                    In aperture synthesis, the irregularly sampled visibilities in UV space are convolved with a gridding function to
                    interpolate their values onto an evenly spaced UV grid. By taking advantage of the redundancy of visibilities inside
                    each UV cell during this gridding process, we identify RFI-corrupted data by comparing these visibilities
                    to some statistical threshold.
                </p>
                <p>
                    GRIDflag shows potential to work effectively in Epoch of Reionization observations, where faint RFI is abundant.

                <h3>Effects of Surrounding Stars on Binary Black Holes</h3>
                <h4>Rochester Institute of Technology (Summer 2023)</h4>
                <p>
                    Binary black holes will inspiral (and, eventually, merge) due to the loss of energy from gravitational radiation.
                    External forces on the system, such as gravity exerted by stars, oppose this inspiraling. Our goal is to analyze
                    how the orbital eccentricity of some binary changes when these stars interact with the system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We utilized Post-Newtonian expansion to generate a simulation of a binary black hole and surrounding stars, using the
                    Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method with interpolation and Numba just-in-time compilation to optimize the simulation. Our results
                    demonstrated that the binary actually spirals inward at a faster rate due to the stars entering and being
                    flung out of the binary's orbit.
